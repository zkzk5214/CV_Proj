# Project 1： 
Modify an existing Siamese Tracker to add functionality that makes it work better.  

## To do lists:
1.    Presentation Part
2.    Report and code part

Deadline: 2/4/2020

## Assignment
### Improve:
1.    Eliminates interference from similar objects
2.    Kalman filter predicts occulsion

### Presentation Part
3-3.5 minute video  (contains an audio narration track) 
Give an overview : what you did for project 1 .  
Outline in detail your technical approach,  emphasize any novel ideas you implemented.  
Show evaluation results.
Q1: Did your work improve the performance of the tracker?  
Q2: What were some of the lessons learned, both pros and cons?  

### Report and code part
Upload as a single zip file your project code and a short written report.  
Report should refer to video results shown in presentation.  
Use the report to provide more detail on motivation, approach, related work, tables/plots showing quantitative performance evaluation, and conclusions.  
This basically will be a write-up of the things you said during your spotlight presentation.

# The theme of this critique assignment is Structure from Motion.  
## Read and write two critiques:  

### One on a paper "Structure from Motion Revisited" by Schonberger and Frahm  
1. The following paper is about COLMAP, the software we are using to do multi-view reconstruction in project.   
It tells us more about what is going on "under the hood" of that program, and the paper starts with a nice general overview of structure from motion. https://demuc.de/papers/schoenberger2016sfm.pdf

### One chosen by you from the reference section of that paper.  
2. For the second critique, choose a paper from the references section of the above COLMAP paper.   
The idea is to do a deeper dive into one of the topics in structure from motion.

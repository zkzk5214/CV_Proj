# For Project 2, answer these questions:
• How many 3D points do you need to hypothesize a plane?  
• Given a minimal sample of points,how do you estimate the parameters of the plane? In fact, how do you parameterize a plane in 3D?  
• Given a hypothesized plane, how do you measure the distance of a 3D point to that plane?
